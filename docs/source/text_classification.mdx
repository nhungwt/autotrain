# Text Classification

Training a text classification model with AutoTrain is super-easy! Get your data ready in
proper format and then with just a few clicks, your state-of-the-art model will be ready to
be used in production.

## Data Format

Let's train a model for classifying the sentiment of a movie review. The data should be
in the following CSV format:

```csv
text,target
"this movie is great",positive
"this movie is bad",negative
.
.
.
```

As you can see, we have two columns in the CSV file. One column is the text and the other
is the label. The label can be any string. In this example, we have two labels: `positive`
and `negative`. You can have as many labels as you want.

If your CSV is huge, you can divide it into multiple CSV files and upload them separately.
Please make sure that the column names are the same in all CSV files.

One way to divide the CSV file using pandas is as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Set the chunk size
chunk_size = 1000
i = 1

# Open the CSV file and read it in chunks
for chunk in pd.read_csv('example.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):
    # Save each chunk to a new file
    chunk.to_csv(f'chunk_{i}.csv', index=False)
    i += 1
```

## Columns

Your CSV dataset must have two columns: `text` and `target`.
