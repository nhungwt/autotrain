# LLM Finetuning

With AutoTrain, you can easily finetune large language models (LLMs) on your own data!

AutoTrain supports the following types of LLM finetuning:

- Causal Language Modeling (CLM)
- Masked Language Modeling (MLM) [Coming Soon]

## Data Preparation

LLM finetuning accepts data in CSV format.

### Data Format For SFT / Generic Trainer

For SFT / Generic Trainer, the data should be in the following format:
